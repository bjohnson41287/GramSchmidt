The GramSchmidt program is a simple C++ program that uses the Gram Schmidt
method to find orthogonal basis vectors from other vectors that span an
n-dimensional space.

Since this is the first program I have written that uses the git version control
system, it is primarily for the purpose of becoming familiar with git and to
learn how to incorporate libraries, Makefiles, and Doxygen into a C++ program
directory structure.

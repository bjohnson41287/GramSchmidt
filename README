The GramSchmidt program is a simple C++ program that uses the Modified
Gram-Schmidt algorithm to find orthonormal basis vectors from a set of n vectors
that may or may not span the n-dimensional vector space.

Since this is the first program I have written that uses the Git version control
system, it is primarily for the purpose of becoming familiar with Git and to
learn how to incorporate libraries, Makefiles, and Doxygen into a C++ program
directory structure.

To clone, compile, and run the program, the following commands need to be run:

1. Clone the GramSchmidt repository
    > git clone git@github.com:bjohnson41287/GramSchmidt

2. Change directories to GramSchmidt and configure the environment
    > cd GramSchmidt
    > source Build/setenv.sh

2. Configure and build the GramSchmidt program
    > Build/GramSchmidt.sh build

3. Run the execuatable
    > exec/GramSchmidt

To generate the Doxygen HTML documentation, execute the following command in
the GramSchmidt directory:
    > doxygen Doxygen/Doxyfile

The HTML documentation can be viewed in any web browser by typing in the full
path to the GramSchmidt/doc/html directory in the address bar and opening the
index.html file.

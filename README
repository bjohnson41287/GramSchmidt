The GramSchmidt program is a simple C++ program that uses the Modified
Gram-Schmidt algorithm to find orthonormal basis vectors from a set of n vectors
that may or may not span the n-dimensional vector space.

Since this is the first program I have written that uses the Git version control
system, it is primarily for the purpose of becoming familiar with Git and to
learn how to incorporate libraries, Makefiles, and Doxygen into a C++ program
directory structure.
